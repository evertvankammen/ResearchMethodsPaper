\section{Plan of work and time schedule}

Creating the NetLogo model involves these tasks:
\begin{itemize}
    \item learning the NetLogo syntax and look at other model examples.
    \item design a grid with roads and city blocks
    \item design the interface, set variables and show data in plots
    \item decide on agents behaviour and program this
    \item find out how to program different scenarios and implementation
    \item export results
\end{itemize}

And the result will be presented in a paper.

In total, I want to spend a maximum of 50 hours in the project.
80\% is for creating the model and testing, 20\% is for literature study and writing the paper.

Starting from 1 June 2024, until the deadline of 10 August 2024, 10 weeks are used for the project.
In those weeks 5 hours a week are put in the project.
During 2 weeks in that period no time is put in the project because of studying for exams.
