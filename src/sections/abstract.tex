An agent-based model has been created to explore the last mile of the food delivery industry.
The design process of this model is described in this paper.
The created model finds differences between hiring deliverers as employees (scenario 1) and seeing them as
independent contractors (scenario 2).
The main difference is the model turns out to be that the number of deliverers can diminish over time in scenario 2.
The result suggest that hiring deliverers as independent contractors will have fewer deliveries but the average per deliverer is much higher.
This is probably why companies in this industry favor this system.
