\section{Results of simulations}\label{sec:results-of-simulations}
During the building of the model it had to be tested to be sure the building blocks worked correctly.

Before trying the 2 variants some simulations where run to check no deliverers could not get stuck in a cycle.








\subsection{Model variant 1}
Here come the results of a variant where deliverers are hired and paid an hourly wage.
The company distributes deliveries equally among the hired employees.
The company has to decide how many to hire and for what periods.


\subsection{Model variant 2}
Here come the results where deliverers are independent contractors.
Deliverers come and go whenever they are pleased, like an open market.
Now, deliverers have to decide whether to become deliverers, stop, or go for a delivery.
To keep it simple, the meals are distributed among the available deliverers.
If a delivery person does not make enough money during the day, they will quit.
