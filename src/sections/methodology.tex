\section{Research methodology}

The development process from Heath et al.~\cite{heath2009survey}, see figure~\ref{fig:steps_simulation},  will be followed.


The process consists of several rounds.

All steps below were conducted in a loop.

Later rounds influenced earlier rounds.

\paragraph{Formulating the problem and objectives}

The formulation of the problem and objectives is complete; they are mentioned as the research goals in the previous section.

\paragraph{Conceptional validation}

The second round consists of building and validating the conceptual model.

%It relies upon known system theories, drives model development, and dictates the variety of assumptions required in any model abstraction process.



The importance of the conceptional model is mentioned by Heath et al.~\cite{heath2009survey}: the conceptual model forms the foundation of an ABM model; an invalid conceptual model indicates the model may not be an appropriate representation of reality.


Therefore, in this round, the abstraction level will be determined.

The model-based approach eliminates all variables not directly related to the problem and preserves only the essence of the situation.

The model must, in a highly abstract way, still mimic some actual behavior and real-world elements.


The conceptional model consists of:\\

\begin{itemize}
    \item agents along with their behavior rules,\\
    \item a world with roads, building, and their rules.\\
\end{itemize}


All other interesting variables must be defined, such as the simulation period, the number of agents of each type, whether agents can leave, and when.

\paragraph{Translate into computer model}

This round converted the conceptual model into computer code.


As mentioned, this study's multi-agent programmable modeling environment was NetLogo~\footnote{\url{ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/}}.


This environment and programming language needed some studying; for this, the NetLogo online user manuals~\footnote{\url{ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/}} and other existing models were used.


A large part of the world is based on an existing model,i.e., the Taxi Cab model~\cite{dongpingtaxicabs2019} see figure~\ref{fig:taxicabmodel}.

\paragraph{Run simulations and obtain results}

With the ready model, simulations were run.

A Python package called pyNetLogo~\footnote{\url{pynetlogo.readthedocs.io/}} was used to automate the simulation and set some variables.

This package can start a NetLogo program, set some variables, and run it for some time.

The results can then be retrieved and used to make diagrams.

This package enables the running of many simulations and automates the making of diagrams.
