\subsection{Agent base moddeling}
The term Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) refers to a class of modeling    methods designed for the study of systems whose dynamics are driven by successive interactions among heterogeneous entities~\cite{tesfatsion2023agent}.

Models of this kind simulate how artificial agents behave in an artificial environment over a certain time period.
These agents can be anything e.g: ants , radioactive nuclei, viruses, as long as they have some properties that can change over time, and they respond to other agents and their environment.

The field of agents in this study is more related to economics, planning and game-theory.

Using ABM in economics is a relatively new~\cite{hamill2016agent}.
In the past modeling would more be like macro- and microeconomic models.
